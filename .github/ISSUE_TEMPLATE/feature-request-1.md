about: In-Game voice chat

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Yes, gamers find it difficult to communicate with one another when there isn't In-Game voice chat as it is not possible for players to communicate properly with one another while playing multiplayer games on PCs, consoles, or mobile.This leads to a bad gaming experience and makes it more difficult for players to communicate and work as a team.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A In-Game voice chat function which allows users to communicate easily on any gaming platform is a feature I would want to see introduced. During multiplayer gaming sessions, this feature should allow users join voice chat, and communicate in real time.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Programs like Discord can be used to connect with pals on many platforms is an alternate method to consider.

**Additional context**
Introducing In-Game voice chat might improve users' game experiences while additionally encouraging teamwork within our gaming platform.
