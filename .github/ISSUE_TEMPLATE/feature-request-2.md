**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
It is true that users' ability to play when they are offline due to internet connectivity is limited by the lack of offline multiplayer challenges. This reduces the whole experience of the game because players lack the chance to play with friends and family while they're not online.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great to have offline multiplayer challenges introduced, which would let players play together without depending on an internet connection. With the help of this function, people may play multiplayer games with their loved ones.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
To offer offline gaming experiences, an alternate approach would be to include offline leaderboards or single-player challenges.

**Additional context**
Including offline multiplayer challenges could improve the gaming experience for those without internet access by offering chances for player bonding and social connection.
